Redir
=====
This is a simple, unpacked, Chrome plugin that checks URLs that the user opens, and if it finds an address it doesn't like [reddit, youtube, twitter, twitch], it redirects to a custom URL.

Easily modifiable, as simple as Copy|Paste|Rewrite|Reload from   [chrome://extensions](extensions) page. Customize to suit your needs.
